               I obtained my BSc and MSc from the University of Buea, 
               Cameroon. Currently I study Biotechnology and 
               Biosafety at Osmangazi Unversity in Turkey at 
               PhD level. I develop in silico bacteria models to 
               simulate metabolism and identify strategies to improve 
               industrial output of bioproducts through genetic 
               engineering. I also serve as a reviewer part-time, 
               genomic data scientist and a science communicator 
               at the COST ACTION European Union Venom Network. 
               I and other students run online academic talk programs
                on GYPEE as well as mentorship and training programs 
                to improve studentsâ€™ research and analytical skills.
